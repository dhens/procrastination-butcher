# An excellent user experience
While this website is mainly to solidify and expand my React skills, I believe there is a large need for excellent and simple user experiences.

Frankly, most websites are overly descriptive and seem to blast you with as much info as it can.

## The Problems
* Clunky or slow website response after user input (clicking a button, having to wait 2+ seconds for an animation to play)
* 

## The Problems of those Problems
* Frustrated users
