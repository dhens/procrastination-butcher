# An excellent user experience
While this website is mainly to solidify and expand my React skills, I believe there is a large need for excellent and simple user experiences.

Frankly, most websites are overly descriptive and seem to blast you with as much info as it can.

## The Problems
* Clunky or slow website response after user input (clicking a button, having to wait 2+ seconds for an animation to play)
* Information *overload*
* Animations on everything

There's a balance to strike between elegance and functionality. If it takes 800ms to load your loading animation for a product after a user clicks on it, that's bad.

## The Solutions
Not minimalism, but evaluate if you REALLY need all the descriptions, icons, and cluttered navbars available to see at ALL times.
